			<h1>Yelping in Culver City in 2019</h1>
			<img src="img/cities.png">

			<p>I started working in Culver City in 2019. Good-bye, suburbs! Culver City was a really exciting place. I loved walking in the neighborhoods along Culver Blvd or through downtown before, during, and after work. It didn't even bother me that I would drive towards work on the weekends. There were Tuesday-afternoon farmers markets, cute boutique shops, trendy restaurants, and occassionally live sets (perks of working right next to Sony).</p>
			
			<p>And then... we relocated!!! ;A; Our office moved to the other side of the 10 freeway which no longer had the same happy-go-lucky feel. If Culver City downtown were Disneyland, then our new place felt like the residential area of Anaheim a block away from the parks. It isn't that bad, but you get the downsides of traffic and crowds while not being included in the exciting part.</p>

			<p>And then... the world went on panic mode due to the virus. Everything felt like they shut down, or I just stopped visiting. I'm still in my room with no sense of time, learning d3 (which I keep telling myself to do), and reflecting back on the fond memories of how life had previously been when I took my first step into the LA city life. </p>

	  			<p>Using the Yelp Business Search API, I got 553 listings (probably an understatement to the number of local businesses) with 161,459 reviews. One location - Father's Office in Downtown Culver - had as many as 5,986 reviews. </p>

	  			<p>3.5 stars? No sweat. That's what most businesses that are likely high-traffic or chains get these days, although I like to bias towards 4s and 5s. Maybe as I become more LA-like I'll raise my expectations...</p>

The size of a circle indicates the number of businesses belonging to that category. Links exist when a business shares both those linked categories. The width of the link represents the similarity between categories.</p>

				<p>Obviously, Culver City has an overwhelming number of Coffee and Tea shops. Many of my coworkers had an <strong>addiction</strong> to the one downstairs. I actually didn't know that there were so many Mexican restaurants in the area, and a lot of them are associated with Fast Food and Food Trucks. The Italian/Pizza scene is on point (although I only tried Pasta Sisters and Roberta's).
